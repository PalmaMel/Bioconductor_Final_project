# Differential expression analysis of the [recount3](https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.recount3) project: **SRP124965**

A Differential expression analysis was performed on the **Epigenome-wide Effects of Vitamin-D on Bronchial Epithelial Cells using ATAC-Seq and RNA-seq** study from the [Recount3 Study Explorer](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount3-study-explorer/) making use of some [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) tools.

**Project description in the Recount3:**
Vitamin D has been associated with viral respiratory infections, the main cause of severe asthma exacerbations in children. We used ATAC-Seq to evaluate the effect of vitamin D on chromatin accessibility in immortalized (BEAS-2B), normal (NHBEC), and asthma (AAEC) bronchial epithelial cells cultured and stimulated with calcitriol, poly I:C (to simulate viral infection), both, or sham (culture media), as well as the effect on gene expression. Overall design: ATAC-Seq and total RNA-Seq were performed on 4 asthma human bronchial epithelial cell samples (AAEC), 4 normal human bronchial epithelial cell samples (NHBEC) and 4 immortalized (BEAS-2B) samples, respectively treated with calcitriol, poly I:C, both or sham (culture media).

# Reduced Protocol

## Previous Steps
The fist part of the analysis consist in the preparation of a [RangedSummarizedExperiment](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/SummarizedExperiment/inst/doc/SummarizedExperiment.html) (RSE) object. The code an a more information about this step can be found in the R script named: `main_script.R`, which code will be pasted below with additional comments:
